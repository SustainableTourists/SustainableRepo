Concepts: 

We could gamifify the system by creating a point system. The point system could tell users something about
how much the person knows about a subject. So we could potentially make ambassadeurs out of members with 
high scores. 

We could make it possible to make a souvenir out of waste people collect. So we could have some shops where 
people come in with waste they have collected, maybe a specific weight, and then we make a souvenir out of it. 

We could ask people if there is a specific area they want to contribute to. Maybe they want to aid the dolphins or 
turtles, and so we can provide them with an opportunity to do that.
